Introduction
============

This add-on demonstrates how to create a project management application in Plone with four Dexterity content types: Client, Project, Iteration, and Task. It also includes a tool to automate the creation of iterations, and a custom workflow for the Client, Project and Iteration types that contains active/inactive states.
