Introduction
============

This is a Dexterity demo application.

It provides "simple" project management features by adding four Dexterity content types: Client,
Project, Iteration, and Task. It also includes a tool to automate creation of iterations.
Finally, there is a project workflow for client, project, and iteration that contains
active/inactive states.

Installation
============

Extend the Dexterity KGS::

    [buildout]
    extends = http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0
    versions = versions

Add ``collective.project`` to instance eggs::

    [plone]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    eggs = collective.project
