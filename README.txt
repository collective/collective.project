Introduction
============

This is a Dexterity demo application.

It aims for "simple" project management in Plone by adding four new Dexterity content types: Client,
Project, Iteration, and Task. It also includes a tool to automate creation of iterations.
Finally, there is a project workflow for client, project, and iteration that contains
active/inactive state(s).
