Introduction
============

Formerly Products.project, this package aims for "simple" project management
with the addition of 4 new content types to Plone: client, project, iteration, 
and task (requires Dexterity). It also includes a tool to automate creation of 
iterations. Finally, there is a project workflow for client, project, and iteration 
that contains active/inactive state(s).
