Installation
============

To install collective.project using zc.buildout, you can do this:

* Add ``collective.dexterity`` to the list of instance eggs, e.g.::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs = 
        ...
        collective.project

* Add ``http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0a2`` to the list of
  buildout extends, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extends =
        ...
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.0a2

  For more information about how to install Dexterity, please see:
  http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/how-to/install.
       
* Add ``collective.project`` to the list of instance eggs, e.g.::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.project

* For Plone 3.2.x and under, tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a 
  ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.project

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file, or if you are using Plone 3.3.x or
higher.
